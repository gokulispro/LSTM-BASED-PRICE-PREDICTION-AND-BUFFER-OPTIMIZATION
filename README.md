# LSTM-BASED-PRICE-PREDICTION-AND-BUFFER-OPTIMIZATION
Our Smart India Hackathon project aims at using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network to predict **zone-wise wholesale prices** of agricultural commodities in India to optimize the buffer stock of the commodities. It handles time series forecasting by creating lag features and training separate LSTM models for each zone.
